# DukeScript Demos

[![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/dukescript/dukescript-demos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dukescript/dukescript-demos)

This project contains a collection of demos for using DukeScript. In the past
we've been developing lots of demos to teach the use of the core technology,
show useful tricks and workarounds, or demonstrate how to use the many libraries. 


These demo projects were distributed on lots of different places, in different
formats. With this project we're trying to collect them and make them available 
from a single place, to make it easier for us to maintain and for you to
find.


Currently these versions are used:

- org.netbeans.html:net.java.html : 1.5.1
- org.apidesign.bck2brwsr:emul : 0.30
- com.dukescript.api:javafx.beaninfo : 0.3



We hope to make this a useful resource for all of us.


The demos here are meant for educational purposes only.
