    * FreeSans: Ships with many Linux distros, including Ubuntu

    * Arimo: Ships with Chrome OS. Arimo has to be defined before Helvetica and
      Arial to get picked up by the browser, even though neither is available
      in Chrome OS.

    * Droid Sans: Ships with all versions of Android.

    * Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif: Common font stack on OS X and Windows.
