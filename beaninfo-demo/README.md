This is a demo of the [JavaFX FXBeanInfo API](https://dukescript.com/javadoc/javafx/).
The FXBeanInfo library allows you to provide information about properties and actions
of a JavaFX based Bean, similar to the classic [BeanInfo](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/BeanInfo.html) does for plain Java Beans.

In this demo, we use FXBeanInfo for binding a Java model to HTML in the same way we ususally do 
with [regular DukeScript @Model](https://dukescript.com/javadoc/html+java/1.5.1/index.html).


The purpose of this library is to simplify using DukeScript in JavaFX. Here's some more information
about the library:


- [Blog entry](https://dukescript.com/javadoc/html+java/1.5.1/index.html)
- [JavaDoc](https://dukescript.com/javadoc/javafx/)


In this demo we use a plain HTML UI. There's a related demo which shows how to 
mix JavaFX and DukeScript based Views:
