This demo implements a sorting game. The aim is to sort 15 numbered tiles. 
You probably remember the mechanical version of this
game from your childhood. Here's a description [in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).

You can play the [game directly here on github](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/dukescript/dukescript-demos/blob/master/fifteen/public_html/index.html), as DukeScript
applications also run in the Browser.
