This demo implements a sorting game. The aim is to sort 15 numbered tiles. 
You probably remember the mechanical version of this
game from your childhood. Here's a description [in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).

You can play the [game directly in your browser](https://dukescript.com/fifteen/index.html).

The game is small, but it still shows alot of neat little tricks like how to 
use animations, how to create a responsive layout, and how to persist state.

Most of it is explained in three blog posts:

The best thing about this game is, that it has a cheat mode, which allows you to
drive everyone crazy. But you'll have to read the sources to find out :-).
